### <a name="Background"></a>Background

In this project we are making data visualizations for the web. We need to visualize the data to communicate our findings to the audience.In order to interact with data, the audience usually would have to have python installed on their systems. However, JavaScript has the power to create data visualizations that are attractive, accessible and interactive. We would be using **Plotly - A JavaScript data visualization library**, which will help our audience to better comprehend the data.
We will also be using JavaScript D3 library, HTML and CSS to buid an interactive dashboard, and display the charts on the web. Also, we will deploy our dashboard on Github Pages, so that the user can directly view our webpage, without any requirement for the server.

### <a name="Purpose"></a>Purpose

Scientists are researching to identify bacterial species that have an ability to synthesize protiens that taste like beef. There is a hypothesis that there is a micro organism that can supply the next best taste. Human body is a source of a thousands of types of bacteria and different parts of the body harbor different species. The hypothesis is that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef can be found in the belly button. To test this hypothesis, we are analyzing the samples of people from across the country to identify the bacterial species that colonize our bellybutton. 

My task is to build a dashboard accessible to the audience. The user can find one's information by selecting the id number from the drop down menu, to see which bacterial species live in their navels. They can explore the information displayed in varipus charts on the dashboard and also compare the information with other individuals as well.
